## Phrase Translator – English to Spanish Practice

A simple, voice-enabled practice tool for everyday English→Spanish phrases. Type (or use the built-in example), then hear the phrase in natural English followed by a clearly Spanish-accented voice. It’s designed to be lightweight, friendly, and focused on repetition and confidence.

### What it’s for
- **Practice simple phrases** you’d actually say in real life.
- **Hear it both ways**: first in English, then in Spanish.
- **Choose the speaking style**: male or female voices for natural-sounding practice.
- **Focus on understanding**: each phrase can be explored in parts, **down to individual words**, so you can internalize meaning and rhythm.

### Why it feels different
- **Bite-sized**: one phrase at a time keeps practice approachable and repeatable.
- **Immediate audio feedback**: listen, repeat, and build confidence.
- **Accent-aware**: Spanish phrases are spoken with a Spanish accent to train your ear.

### How to use it (at a glance)
- Open the app and run the main script; it speaks a test phrase in English and Spanish.
- Swap the phrase or voice preference to suit your session.

### What’s next
- Deeper **phrase breakdowns** (word-by-word highlights and notes).
- Simple **practice loops** for spaced repetition.
- Optional **progress tracking** to celebrate streaks and milestones.

Practice a little every day—short, clear phrases, spoken naturally. ¡Vamos!
